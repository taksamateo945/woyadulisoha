The 40-year-old has said the sex was consensual.</p><p>Alves' story changed several times during the investigation. He initially said he did not know the woman, later told police they met in the bathroom but no sexual contact occurred, and he finally admitted the two had oral sex but claimed it was consensual.</p><p>Alves claimed his lies were an attempt to hide cheating on his wife. Joana Sanz separated from Alves in March 2023.</p><p>The woman said Alves slapped her and raped her during their encounter. She said she initially went to the bathroom with Alves willingly, but he would not allow her to leave when she tried stopping his advances.</p><p>He admitted to being drunk on the night in question.</p><p>A right back who played 22 years of professional soccer, Alves was under contract with UNAM in Mexico at the time of his arrest.

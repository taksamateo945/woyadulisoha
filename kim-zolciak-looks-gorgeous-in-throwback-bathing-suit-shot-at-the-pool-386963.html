Kim Zolciak shared the image which was apparently a teaser from an older shoot for her skincare line Kashmere.
It seems like Kim has a lot more free time while in quarantine so she has been looking through her old photos."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I have some great eyes, great hearts and good souls making sure we ‘Got’ the shot! Love these 2 @kroybiermann and @mrdblanks.’</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-0ho1eDR8-/</p><p>Of course, it looks like she shouted out her hubby and the photographer, both of whom can be seen in the shot as well, their backs turned to the camera.</p><p>As mentioned before, the photo is a throwback to her launch of her skincare line back in 2016.</p><p>At the time, she proudly announced on Don’t Get Tardy that ‘I have finally launched my dream, Kashmere is my new skincare line. torn between doing a lemon-y, clean scent or more of a stripper scent.’</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Seeing the throwback pic, fans were quick to gush over Kim, commenting things like: ‘This has always been my fave shoot, so sweet how kroy supports u and is always there.’ / ‘You’re a beauty, Kim -‘d the whole family ! Blessed.’ / ‘I love the way [Kroy] looks way you! I love for the day for that.’</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGebnrpuxs6lmqKZm2K5sLvKrGSgp6KcsrDB0magp2Wknb%2Bww8GamqRlkpbBqbXNoGSsrZmperS0zq1kmqxdqbWmec%2BopqVlY22DeoKSaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

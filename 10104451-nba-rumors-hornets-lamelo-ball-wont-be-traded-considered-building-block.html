Per ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski, the Hornets have &#34;no intention&#34; of trading Ball, who is considered &#34;one of their building blocks&#34; with rookie Brandon Miller.
Miller, the No. 2 overall pick in the 2023 NBA draft, has shown promising signs during his rookie campaign."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He's averaging 14.3 points on 36.8 percent three-point shooting in 30 appearances.</p><p>The Hornets have lost 13 of their last 14 games and own the third-worst record in the Eastern Conference at 8-26 overall.</p><p>One reason they are sitting near the bottom of the NBA standings is because Ball hasn't played since Nov. 26. He suffered a sprained ankle in the second quarter against the Orlando Magic.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Roderick Boone</a> of the <i>Charlotte Observer </i>reported on Monday that Ball is "in the final phase of his rehabilitation" and could be back "relatively soon" after being a full participant in Sunday's practice.</p><p>Ball looked like he had taken his game to another level before suffering the injury. He was averaging a career-high 24.7 points on 38.8 percent three-point shooting with 8.2 assists and 5.5 rebounds per game in 15 starts.</p><p>The Hornets aren't exactly loaded with talent right now, so the idea of trading a 22-year-old point guard who has already made an All-Star team wouldn't be good business. He also just <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> a five-year max extension in July that ties him to the organization through 2028-29.</p><p>Terry Rozier is the <a href=# rel=noopener>best trade chip</a> the Hornets have to play if they want to add future assets. He's <a href=# rel=noopener>signed</a> through the 2024-25 season with a partial guarantee for 2026-27.</p><p>Ball's injury may have helped Rozier increase his trade value. The 29-year-old is averaging a career-high 24.3 points and 7.2 assists per game in 23 starts this season.</p><p>If the Hornets can get Ball and Miller on the court together for the second half of the season, they will be able to get a proper glimpse of what their future is going to look like.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGmBdn2Mp5maZaKqurC%2B0mafqKqemsG0ecuapJ6kn2KvorjLZq6opqRir6Z506uYnZ2UYrCwutKim56qlZl6o8HIpZuippdir627wqQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

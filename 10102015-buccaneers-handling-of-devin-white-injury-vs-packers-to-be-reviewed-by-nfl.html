Head coach Todd Bowles raised eyebrows, given the possibility of injury reporting violations, with comments he made on Monday about White's absence from Sunday's game."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On one hand, he told me here he didn't approach Devin White about taking a rotational role, but he then said they did talk about rotating and White "was fine when we talked." &lt;a href="https://t.co/oKqIcPjfRv">pic.twitter.com/oKqIcPjfRv&lt;/a></p><p>The obvious speculation is that White perhaps isn't thrilled about a rotational role. Given that he never finished a season with fewer than 90 tackles, recorded triple-digit tackles three times in his career and was a Pro Bowler in 2021, that possibility wouldn't be the biggest surprise.</p><p>Given that potential context, Bowles' comments could have been a clumsy attempt to keep White's discontent out of the public spotlight. Or perhaps there was simply some miscommunication between the parties.</p><p>Either way, the situation has now earned the attention of the NFL.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGd9coGMm6ycm5Gjsqa%2B0mafmqaUobavs4yonWaclau2r3nWoaCtnV2eu6vB0bJkr6tdpa6kt8Srqmasn2KvpnnRnq2inaeasW6u2Galn6Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

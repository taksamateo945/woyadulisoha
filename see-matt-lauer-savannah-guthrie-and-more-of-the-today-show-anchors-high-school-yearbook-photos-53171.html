Although it was hard for them to claw their way to the top, the trio didn’t give up their dream of someday becoming a major figure at an entertainment network.</p><p>In 1989, Hoda got her start when she became a weekend anchor at WINK in Fort Myers, Florida. After doing that for two years, the mom of two to kids Haley Joy and Hope Catherine worked at a couple more news stations before landing a job at NBC News in 1998.</p><p>Her journey to stardom is something Savannah and Al can both relate to. In 2007, Savannah joined the network after Al became the forecaster for Weekend Today in the mid-’90s. He did so well there that the meteorologist showed off his stuff when he reported from inside Hurricane Wilma in 2005. However, Al didn’t start working with Savannah until she became a Today cohost in 2011. Once the journalists were on the news program together, they had a lot of good moments on air.</p><p>“I have a great partner in Hoda. Don’t get me wrong, I’ve always thought this was the best job and I loved working with <a href=#><strong>Matt [Lauer]</strong></a>. He was a great partner, but working with Hoda is a joy,” Savannah gushed during a previous interview with <a href=#>TV Insider</a>. “I’ve never been happier, more satisfied and more at peace.”</p><p>It also helps that the Emmy winner gets along great with her coworkers. “You can’t fake chemistry,” Savannah said. “I can tell when coanchors don’t get along. If you have that rapport, it makes people want to spend time with you. And that’s what we hope to do — invite viewers to share their mornings with us.”</p><p>Talk about a great work environment.</p><p><strong>Scroll through the gallery below to see photos of your favorite Today stars then and now!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9KenGalkanBbrjArpyrZaOWw6K6zZqfZp%2BlqbWztcRmmKecXaK8s7GMqJ1mrJiaerW7w5qwZquYpMRurc2cn6iqo2K1qrPHZqqcoJ%2BkuW7FxJqpm6efoHqxtM6tpqxlZWh%2BeH2OqZ%2BorJ%2BofLW7w5qwZquYpMRur8Csq2ZwYmZ%2Fcg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

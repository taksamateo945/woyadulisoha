Reeves does what he needs to do to get things done. It appears that he loves the life he lives, and lives the life he loves—and that’s inspiring to us all!

He follows his passions without losing sight of who he is as a person.</p><p>Related: The Fitness Habits Arnold Schwarzenegger Lives by Still Work at 74</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/judo-concept.jpg><p>Another fun fact? Reeves apparently recruited an ex-MMA fighter, Eric Brown, to be his sensei to help him prepare for a role. “I had a little experience in movie fighting, but I’d never done judo,” he explains. “At the beginning, I didn’t even know where to put my feet. So it was a lot of me learning the basics.” He became an actual expert in judo (via Men’s Journal).<span aria-hidden=true>6254a4d1642c605c54bf1cab17d50f1e</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/keanu-reeves-1.jpg><p>Reeves worked with personal trainer Patrick Murphy to prepare for his role in “John Wick,” which required a lot of stunts, tumbling, fight scenes, stunt car driving, and more, according to Esquire. When discussing their training together, Murphy reveals, “It’s about being able to maintain a positive rhythm with his joints, and to reduce any pain as much as possible.” The weekly routine Reeves performed helped him do all of these stunts to the best of his ability. He worked on muscular endurance training, corrective exercise, power training, balance training, and recovery techniques.</p><p>Related: The Fitness Habits Tom Cruise Follows To Stay Young and in Shape at 59</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/keanu-reeves.jpg><p>Why do we think&nbsp;Keanu Reeves is a&nbsp;really&nbsp;nice guy? Well, plain and simple,&nbsp;he was recently&nbsp;dubbed a “class act” by&nbsp;Andrew Kimmel, a TV producer. The title was&nbsp;based on welcoming responses Reeves gave&nbsp;to a young fan after a long&nbsp;flight.&nbsp;A recap of the conversation was tweeted, and&nbsp;it was re-tweeted more than 22.5K times&nbsp;since. Apparently,&nbsp;the young&nbsp;boy&nbsp;curiously fired “rapid-fire questions” to Reeves,&nbsp;who “happily” answered them all.&nbsp;To be precise,&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>Kimmel’s tweet</a> reads, “Keanu Reeves was on my flight from London to NYC today. A young boy asked for an autograph at baggage & then began to fire off a series of rapid-fire questions. Keanu happily responded to every single one…”</p><p>If you’re already in&nbsp;agreement that&nbsp;Reeves is&nbsp;pretty cool&nbsp;for doing this, read on, because there’s more&nbsp;to love about the celeb.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/keanu-reeves-motorcycle.jpg><p>Reeves&nbsp;has some pretty impressive interests,&nbsp;which could be why the star looks&nbsp;so much&nbsp;younger than his&nbsp;57 years of&nbsp;age. Cool fact number three? In this his spare time, Reeves apparently collects and designs motorcycles. A very treasured bike in the actor’s collection is a gorgeous Arch KRGT-1 “performance cruiser,” and it’s reportedly the special design chosen to launch ARCH Motorcycle, a motorcycle shop Reeves co-founded with Gard Hollinger.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.eatthis.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2022/08/keanu-reeves-3.jpg><p>Still going strong, Reeves will be the host of Disney+’s totally new, four-part series spotlighting Formula 1. The series will encompass Ross Brawn’s time as the Honda team principal. (Brawn is currently the F1 managing director.)</p><p>Reeves is pumped about this venture, revealing during the British Grand Prix, “A friend of mine was telling me the story and I was so struck by it and he was actually working for Brawn back in the day in publicity and he’s a producer/director and so we were like, ‘Well, let’s tell that story, let’s try and tell that story.’ It’s been really great to be able to learn more about what was going on in Formula One that year. It wasn’t just the cars, new regulations, FOTA [the Formula One Teams Association] breakaway series. I mean there was just so much happening in Formula One at that time” (via Men’s Health).</p><p>Another&nbsp;project Reeves has in the works is the role&nbsp;of&nbsp;Daniel H. Burnham, an architect for the 1893 World’s Fair, in a brand new limited series on Hulu. “The Devil in the White City” is a nonfiction thriller being produced by Leonardo DiCaprio&nbsp;and Martin&nbsp;Scorsese.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82uq6uhpJ68r3vKnpinrV2nsqbCxKxkbm9doba3sdJmmbJlpJ2ytLGMoZyapKSdxm6yyK1koZmSnsG0ecSaq2asmJ7AbrrOrWStoJGpfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

At the time, demonstrators were in Kenosha protesting the officer-related shooting of Jacob Blake, who was paralyzed after being shot seven times in the back.</p><p>Rittenhouse, who is from Illinois, was accused of using an illegally-obtained AR-15-style weapon to carry out last year’s shooting in Wisconsin. He claimed while at the protest, he was hit in the head and neck with a baseball bat and skateboard. While medics reportedly observed superficial scratches on his arm, they did not see any bruising or cuts.</p><p>Rittenhouse’s friend, Dominick Black, 19, allegedly asked Rittenhouse to join him in protecting a Car Source business during the protest. However, multiple reports indicated that the owner of the Car Source never asked the pair to guard his business.</p><p>Black was arrested last November for allegedly buying the gun Rittenhouse used in the deadly shooting. Black allegedly used Rittenhouse’s money to make the purchase in Ladysmith, Wisconsin, but the weapon was registered to Black’s name.</p><p>After the shooting, Black allegedly drove Rittenhouse back to Antioch, Illinois, where Rittenhouse was arrested days later.</p><p><strong>For the latest true crime and justice news, subscribe to the ‘Crime Stories with Nancy Grace’ podcast.

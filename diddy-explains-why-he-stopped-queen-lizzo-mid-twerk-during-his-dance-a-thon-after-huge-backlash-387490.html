Even while in quarantine, Diddy and a couple of other celebs though they should at least have an online meet-up and have a lot of fun while at it since there was a holiday.</p><p>Furthermore, it was also for the good of humanity since it was a fundraiser as well.</p><p>But, things took quite a turn for the worst since Diddy ended up in hot water over stopping Lizzo from twerking during the livestream.</p><p>Now, Diddy returned to social media to defend himself and explain the real reason why he did that to his ‘queen’ Lizzo.</p><p>As it turns out, he was definitely not trying to shade or body shame her like many social media users thought.</p><p>Apparently, all he wanted to do when he interrupted her dancing was to change the song since it was filled with curse words.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B-7C9MfhYGb/</p><p>‘There’s one thing that I want to make clear — my queen, my sister Lizzo. When I stopped the music, it was ‘cause it had a lot of curses in there. Not ‘cause she was twerking. [Lizzo is] one of the best twerkers in the world, okay? So, let’s keep that clear. It wasn’t about twerking. You are allowed to twerk on Easter. There was just a lot of cursing in the record and I don’t need child services knocking on my door right now. So, that’s why I stopped the record.’</p><p>He went on to remind people about all the good that his dance-a-thon, urging them to focus on that and not on their own negative assumptions.</p><p>‘Lizzo we love you, and everybody stop looking for the negative! Look for the positive. Let’s go to the love!’ he concluded his message on IG Stories.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sure enough, the rapper’s Team Love COVID-19 Response Fund has managed to raise nearly $4 million at this time and continues to gather more.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeUnrGlxYyer6mkkZ67tHnWobBmoJViwLW7z6mcnWWhqrKmuoyloLOyn2K6qrCMra6eqptisba%2ByKeeZqCZqHqlrc2cnGaZXam1sLqMmp2tnaJitbazxGaZmpuboa60tIxsb3BsaWV8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

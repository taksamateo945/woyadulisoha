We were cops together, we were detectives together. So I just come back as that character,” Leah said of playing Vanessa. “I loved [being reunited with Kevin]. It’s an amazing feeling.”</p><p>Turns out, Leah and Kevin never gave up on their friendship even though King of Queens ended 10 years ago. “We’re always in touch. She’s in my life forever. I can’t get rid of her!” Kevin previously joked to <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. Leah added, “We’ve seen each other. It was cool reuniting the two characters.”</p><p>That said, Leah’s decision to join the show for good was an easy one. “I got a call: ‘Do you want to do some more episodes?’ I said, ‘Yeah, of course, anything,'” she shared. “They said, ‘Okay, so you’re going to be doing all the episodes.’ I was like, ‘What?! For Kevin, anything.” We can’t wait to see the TV duo back in action during the Season 2 premiere of Kevin Can Wait come Monday, Sept. 25!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2OwrbvSnqmwnZWgubp6wqikaKifqMG0e9OhnGarpKeuqrqMpJyvoZ5isba%2BwKebZpqRl8Zus8iro2ZuaWWCcQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

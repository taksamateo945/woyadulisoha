“I heard him make the announcement and he said he wanted to run in 2020. I would only ask him if I’m running for reelection to wait,” she told the talk show host."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The Democractic candidate told <strong>Ellen DeGeneres </strong>during an interview on Tuesday, Sept. 8, that she hopes she won’t ever have to run against the rapper.</p><p>“I heard him make the announcement and he said he wanted to run in 2020. I would only ask him if I’m running for reelection to wait,” she told the talk show host. “But, otherwise, a lot of people want to run for president these days,” Clinton, 67, quipped.&nbsp;</p><p>In case you somehow missed it, <strong>Kim Kardashian’</strong>s husband, 38, announced his plans to run for president in 2020 while accepting the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award at the 2015 MTV VMAs last month. After a lengthy, awkward speech, West declared: “I’ve decided in 2020 to run for president!”</p><p>Although it’s unclear if West is actually serious about running for president, Clinton’s daughter, <strong>Chelsea Clinton</strong>, revealed she thinks his declaration will at least help encourage others. "Who runs for office is really important," the 35-year-old new mom told MTV. "And even if [West] just saying that helps spark a little boy or a little girl who was watching the VMAs to think, 'Oh wow, maybe I should do that,' that's awesome."&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As for if the former First Daughter would vote for the “FourFiveSeconds” singer, Chelsea was a bit more reserved with her answer. "I think it depends on who he'd be running against," she told MTV.</p><p>One candidate who would look forward to running against West, naturally, is <strong>Donald Trump</strong>. "He's actually a different kind of person than people think," the Republican hopeful told Rolling Stone. "He's a nice guy. I hope to run against him someday."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaJ%2BipJyWv7p5wqWgp6yfo3qlu8Sspa1lp5a7tXnTqGSrrZ5irqityKeqrWWblru6sYywnKysXZ67bn6Pa2dmamBmgnqF</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

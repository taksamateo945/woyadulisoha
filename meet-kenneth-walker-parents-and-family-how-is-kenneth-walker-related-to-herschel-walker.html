Ted Budd, who is running for Senate in North Carolina.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>An Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll found Walker and incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., locked in a dead heat two months ahead of midterm elections, with the Democrat leading over Walker 46-44 percent. But a Quinnipiac polll released last week found a wider difference – Warnock leading 52 to 46 percent. The two candidates will participate in a debate on Oct. 15.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Senate GOP leaders initially balked at Walker’s candidacy, worried about the past domestic abuse allegations he chalks up to his past struggles with mental health.

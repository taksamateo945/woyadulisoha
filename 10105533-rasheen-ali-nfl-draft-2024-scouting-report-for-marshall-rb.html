He plays with fairly quick feet, allowing him to weave across the line of scrimmage at will. Moreover, Ali is quick to bend and cut up the field when he sees it. All of that movement is done in one seamless, explosive effort.</p><p>Ali also has good burst in the open field. Once he clears the line of scrimmage, he can accelerate to a solid top speed and really make defensive backs work to take the right angle on him. Ali is an effective runner on the perimeter because of that.</p><p>At the same time, Ali lacks the skills to dominate between the tackles. He is an upright runner who lacks good leg drive and balance. Not only is Ali easily tripped up at the ankles, but he is stopped on first contact more often than not. He can occasionally spin and wiggle out of trouble, but he doesn't often make it past first contact.</p><p>Additionally, Ali is not a commanding runner. He is sometimes hesitant to hit the hole downhill if he believes something may still open up on the outside. Even when Ali does take initiative downhill, he just doesn't have the strength or violence to make the most of it.</p><p>Ali is a quick-twitch back fit for a change-of-pace role in the NFL. His quickness and burst out on the edge will make him a nice changeup for teams with a heavier, stronger lead back. Ali would fit best in an outside-zone scheme that enables him to hunt for plays on the perimeter.</p><p><b>GRADE</b>: 5.7 (Backup/Draftable — 6th/7th Round)</p><p><b>OVERALL RANK</b>: 210</p><p><b>POSITION RANK</b>: RB15</p><p><b>PRO COMPARISON</b>: Ke'Shawn Vaughn</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGqCdH%2BMq5isoJWau26ty6Jkp56cYrGzrcWtZGtoYml6tK%2FOrquippdiv6a8zqurZp6fp3qurdGsn5qknGK%2Fow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

The funnyman, who is now happily married to wife Kyla Weber, with whom he has two kids, dished to Playboy magazine about dating the A-list Friends alum for over a year back in 2006, explaining why he was hesitant to divulge much about their relationship at the time.

According to <strong><a href=#>Vince Vaughn</a></strong>, it’s “great” —&nbsp;for the most part, at least.</p><p>The funnyman, who is now happily married to wife <strong>Kyla Weber</strong>, with whom he has two kids, dished to <a href=#>Playboy magazine</a> about dating the A-list Friends alum for over a year back in 2006, explaining why he was hesitant to divulge much about their relationship at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>"You know, she’s great," the True Detective star told Playboy mag. "For me personally — and I think most well-known actors who are together feel this way — I never enjoyed the paparazzi side of it. You like someone and you’re spending time with them; that’s separate and that was all fine. But I really spent most of that time finding ways not to be drawn into the attention."</p><p>And avoiding “the attention” was quite the task, considering Vaughn dated his Break-Up costar following her highly publicized divorce from <strong><a href=#>Brad Pitt</a> </strong>in 2005.</p><p>“I think lying low and not talking about it put me in a good position later,” he continued. “Because I just wasn’t part of anything.”</p><p>“I call Vince my defibrillator,” Aniston then told Vogue after they called it quits on their relationship. “He literally brought me back to life. My first gasp of air was a big laugh! It was great. I love him. He’s a bull in a china shop. He was lovely and fun and perfect for the time we had together. And I needed that. And it sort of ran its course.”&nbsp;</p><p>Fast-forward to 2015 and Vaughn’s officially settled down — but that took him some time.&nbsp;</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I waited until I was a little older, and I’m glad,” the Couples Retreat star, who said “I do” at the age of 39, said. “I just hadn’t matured in that area. A lot of people think, ‘Oh, I’ve got to focus on my career.’ And then you wake up and go, ‘Oh goodness, I forgot about the rest of my life.’ Marriage is terrific, but it’s the hardest thing I think you’ll ever do."</p><p>“You have to really work at it and want it,” he added. "I got to an age when it was something that seemed exciting. I wanted kids and a family, but I wouldn’t have at 30. You know how it is. You’ve been making decisions about what you’re going to do on your own. Suddenly you’re making those decisions with somebody else. It’s a much different journey.”</p><p>Vaughn married Weber in January 2010 in a quiet ceremony in Lake Forest, Illinois, after popping the question on Valentine’s Day in 2009. Aniston, for her part, is happily engaged and gearing up to marry longtime love<strong> <a href=#>Justin Theroux</a></strong>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK2ippOaeret1KCfp2WimrCiuMusZJ2ZpJ67qHnJnqWnoZaav26tzaKqraeeYrWiwMSdZK2glWKutcDEp6uip55if3F9lGppaw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.

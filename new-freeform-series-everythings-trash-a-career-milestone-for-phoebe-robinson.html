I love burping into the mic. I just like doing anything that’s going to make someone laugh and loosen up, so it’s really cool.”</p><p>To visit the set is to mark a milestone in the career of a determined woman who worked for 14 years to get her own show.</p><p>She’s a star who is now welcomed in some of the same offices where she once worked as a receptionist.</p><p>“I really didn’t make a living doing standup until nine years into it, so yeah, I was just kind of hustling,” she said. “I had all these side jobs or day jobs, and you really got to put in a lot of work in standup in order to make it.”</p><p>And make it she has, by following the traditional advice to “write what you know.”</p><p><b>ALSO READ | Jonas brothers Kevin and Frankie host ABC’s ‘Claim to Fame’</b></p><p>For example, Robinson’s older brother on the show is just like her real older brother. She calls him a “blerd.”</p><p>“A blerd is a Black nerd, so like a Steve Urkel or like myself sometimes,” she said.</p><p>This is a fun, enjoyable show for adults.</p><p>It airs on Freeform Wednesday nights and begins streaming on Hulu the following day.

The Celtics had ample potential to succeed with All Star-caliber players in Hayward and Kyrie Irving, along with emerging talents in Jayson Tatum, Jaylen Brown and Terry Rozier. Despite a seemingly stacked roster, Boston fell short in the second round of the playoffs to the Milwaukee Bucks.
Making an appearance on Podcast P with Paul George, Hayward said he believes the team got in its own way."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"Kyrie was hurt the year before, didn't miss the playoffs. So he's trying to prove this is still his team. Then you've got (Jayson Tatum) and Jaylen (Brown) and Terry (Rozier) coming off where they're all starting, make it to the Eastern Conference Finals a year before. They're all trying to prove, like, 'We've arrived.'"</p><p>Aside from personal goals, Hayward also thinks having a roster with so much talent got in the way. With several capable scoring options playing in similar positions, it made it difficult for the Celtics to distribute the scoring evenly.</p><p>"We had probably eight players who had career highs over 40, who were all arguably in their prime," Hayward said. "The other problem is there were too many of us in the exact same position. We all needed the ball, we all rocked with the ball, we all needed the ball."</p><p>Despite coming up short in the playoffs, the Celtics put together a solid 49-33 season behind the duo of Hayward and Irving. That year was Irving's final year in Boston, though, as he left for the Brooklyn Nets that summer.</p><p>Now several years removed from the 2018-19 team, the Celtics are finding success behind the guidance of Tatum and Brown, and they're looking to accomplish what they couldn't do a few seasons ago.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYGh%2FdYKMoKarnJ%2Bjeqmt2LCYq5xdqK66v4xrZ2pwXWaGbq%2FEpauim6NixKrAx2aisqqZmnqqvtWipaBlmJaxbsDOqGSmmZ6ueqKzxKebmqs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

He averaged 14.9 points, 4.7 assists and 4.5 rebounds in 40 games and led the Tigers to a 38-2 overall record. They made the National Championship, losing out to Kansas 75-68 in overtime for the title.</p><p>He earned Third-Team All-American honors and would be a finalist for the Bob Cousy and John Wooden Awards. He would go on to be the No. 1 pick of his hometown Chicago Bulls in the 2008 NBA Draft.</p><p>Rose wore No. 25 in high school, but switched to No. 23 with the Tigers because the school had retired No. 25 for Penny Hardaway. He would revert to No. 1 with the Bulls before finally getting No. 25 when he joined the New York Knicks in 2017. He would also add No. 4 to his jersey collection, but now finally wears his college number.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGloaGaCeYGMnZyrqpmYuG6%2BzqycZqyfYsSmrdFmoZ6qo5rGbrrOZmlsZaeewal5xqugs7KcnrK0edaoqZ5lnqq6o7HRZq6irJhiuqa5z6GgrGWknrSmvtI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.

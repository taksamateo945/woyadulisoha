He has not ever really been sick, and for me, I think the more research I do, and the more educated I have become, I just do not vaccinate him. You are a parent, you know what is best for your child, and I am not here to judge.’</p><p>And it sounds like she really has nothing against it either since she claims she did not care when her former husband Javi Marroquin had their son Lincoln get a flu shot.</p><p>Still, she confessed that looking back, she feels ‘ignorant’ for letting the doctors vaccinate her oldest son Isaac.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>By not vaccinating your child than having them around other children you're putting those kids at risk..where we live if your child isn't vaccinated hey can not go to school</p><p>— lisaseal (@lisaseal20) <a href=# rel=nofollow>January 26, 2019</a></p><p>As you can imagine, it did not take a long time before social media users started to slam her for such a dangerous choice, but even so, Lowry is still defending her decision.</p><p>Mostly, people were angry that she uses her podcast as a way to spread misinformation to other mothers out there.</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>During an interview with In Touch Weekly, she argued: ‘I mean, I guess the only thing I can really say and continue to stand for is to parent how it’s best for your child and family.

So as you can see below, the ostrich siblings had experience with elephants since they were babies.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Jotto-the-orphan-elephant-Kenya.jpg><p>The ostriches grew up alongside several orphaned elephants. But as Pod got bigger, it became clear that Pod was a male, as males become aggressive as they age. He eventually went out on his own to link up with wild ostriches after not returning as usual with the herd.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pea-and-Pod-rescued-ostrich-chicks-Kenya.jpg><p>Pea was a female, who are known to be more gentle and friendly than their male counterparts. She was happy to return and stay with her elephant crew.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pea-ostrich-and-Jotto-elephant-friends-5.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Jotto, the orphaned elephant, arrives</h2><p>In early 2016, Jotto was found trapped in a well. The one-month-old elephant was luckily saved, but one of the kind elephant keepers who rescued him suddenly collapsed and died.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pea-ostrich-and-Jotto-elephant-friends-3.jpg><p>Now two years old, Pea was still enjoying life with her elephant heard. Then when she met baby Jotto, they had an instant connection. The happy couple were often seen cuddling, playing, and taking naps together.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pea-ostrich-and-Jotto-elephant-friends-4.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What happened to Jotto the Elephant and Pea the Ostrich?</h2><p>In late 2016, the orphaned elephant herd and Pea were out feeding in a forest. Then suddenly, three lions chasing a heard of impala came through, scattering the elephants. The keepers were able to round up the elephants but couldn’t find Pea… They continued their search and eventually found several lions had killed her. Jotto continues to be alive and well at the Sheldrick Wildlife Trust.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebritypets.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Pea-ostrich-and-Jotto-elephant-friends-1.jpg><p>While their love story was tragically cut short, they still continue to bring joy to anyone who learns about them.
